## Raw LLM Response

This is the individual strategic plan generated by the Leader Agent:

### Hotdog-Sandwich Taxonomy Resolution Framework

**Timeline:** 12-18 months

#### Step 1: Establish a Hotdog-Sandwich Classification Commission

**Prerequisites:**
- Secure buy-in from key stakeholder groups

**Expected Outcome:** Create a legitimate, authoritative body to define taxonomic standards

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty achieving consensus on commission composition
- Potential for continued polarization if commission is seen as biased

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 2: Develop a Hybrid Taxonomy Model

**Prerequisites:**
- Commission conducts thorough review of structural, cultural, and practical considerations
- Commission engages broad stakeholder input

**Expected Outcome:** Establish a taxonomy that recognizes both structural and cultural dimensions of hotdogs and sandwiches

**Key Risks:**
- Resistance from purists on both sides unwilling to compromise
- Complexity of model may reduce practical utility

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 3: Implement Flexible Classification Standards

**Prerequisites:**
- Hybrid taxonomy model is finalized
- Commission establishes clear guidelines and decision frameworks

**Expected Outcome:** Allow for contextual application of hotdog vs. sandwich designations based on specific use cases

**Key Risks:**
- Potential for continued disputes over edge cases and ambiguous items
- Lack of clear enforcement mechanisms

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 4: Launch Public Education Campaign

**Prerequisites:**
- Taxonomy model and standards are established
- Key stakeholders endorse the framework

**Expected Outcome:** Increase public awareness and acceptance of the hybrid classification approach

**Key Risks:**
- Entrenched beliefs may be difficult to change
- Potential for backlash from purists unwilling to accept the compromise

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 5: Establish Dispute Resolution Processes

**Prerequisites:**
- Public education campaign is underway
- Formal taxonomic authority is recognized

**Expected Outcome:** Provide structured mechanisms to address ongoing classification disagreements

**Key Risks:**
- Potential for disputes to persist despite formal processes
- Difficulty enforcing decisions if stakeholders refuse to comply

**Confidence:** 0.8
