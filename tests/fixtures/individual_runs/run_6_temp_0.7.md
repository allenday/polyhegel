This is the individual strategic plan generated by the Leader Agent:

### Hotdog-Sandwich Taxonomy Consensus Framework

**Timeline:** 18-24 months

#### Step 1: Establish Joint Taxonomy Review Board

- Board unable to reach consensus on classification criteria

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 2: Define Tiered Taxonomy System

**Prerequisites:**
- Taxonomy Review Board established
- Conduct research on existing food classification frameworks

**Expected Outcome:** Develop multi-level taxonomy that balances structural, cultural, and practical considerations

**Key Risks:**

- Disagreements on placement of specific food items

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 3: Establish Dual-Labeling Standards

**Prerequisites:**
- Tiered taxonomy system defined
- Engage with food service industry, regulators, and consumer groups

**Expected Outcome:** Allow for both structural and cultural labels (e.g. 'Elongated Bread-Encased Meat Product' and 'Hotdog')

**Key Risks:**
- Dual-labeling seen as overly burdensome or confusing
- Disagreements on primary vs secondary labeling

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 4: Launch Public Education Campaign

**Prerequisites:**
- Taxonomy and dual-labeling standards established
- Secure buy-in from major media outlets and food influencers

**Expected Outcome:** Inform and engage general public on new food classification framework

**Key Risks:**

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 5: Institutionalize Taxonomy Governance

**Prerequisites:**
- Public education campaign successful
- Secure regulatory and legislative support

**Expected Outcome:** Enshrine taxonomy system into law, regulations, and industry standards

**Key Risks:**
- Ongoing legal/political challenges to taxonomy
- Failure to keep pace with evolving food landscape

**Confidence:** 0.8
