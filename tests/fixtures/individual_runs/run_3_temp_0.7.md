## Raw LLM Response

This is the individual strategic plan generated by the Leader Agent:

### Hotdog-Sandwich Taxonomy Framework

**Timeline:** 12-18 months

#### Step 1: Establish a Hotdog-Sandwich Classification Commission

**Prerequisites:**
- Secure buy-in from key stakeholder groups

**Expected Outcome:** Create an authoritative body to define taxonomic standards

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty gaining consensus on commission composition
- Potential for commission rulings to be ignored or challenged

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 2: Develop a Hybrid Taxonomic Model

**Prerequisites:**
- Commission has defined membership and operating procedures

**Expected Outcome:** Establish a framework that recognizes both structural and cultural classification criteria

**Key Risks:**
- Resistance from purists on both sides
- Difficulty translating hybrid model into clear, practical guidelines

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 3: Implement Flexible Labeling and Dual-Classification Standards

**Prerequisites:**
- Hybrid taxonomic model is defined and approved
- Regulations and industry standards are updated

**Expected Outcome:** Allow for multiple valid classification options on menus, packaging, and regulations

**Key Risks:**
- Potential consumer confusion from ambiguous labeling
- Resistance from stakeholders seeking clear, universal definitions

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 4: Launch Public Education Campaign

**Prerequisites:**
- Taxonomic framework and dual-classification standards are established

**Expected Outcome:** Increase public understanding and acceptance of the hybrid model

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty overcoming entrenched views and biases
- Potential for continued debate and controversy

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 5: Establish Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

**Prerequisites:**
- Public education campaign is underway
- Regulatory bodies have adopted the hybrid taxonomy

**Expected Outcome:** Create formal processes for stakeholders to resolve classification disputes

**Key Risks:**
- Resistance to third-party mediation and arbitration
- Potential for rulings to be ignored or challenged

**Confidence:** 0.8

### Strategic Alignment

- **Respects both structural and cultural perspectives:** 4.0/5.0
- **Establishes legitimate taxonomic authority:** 4.0/5.0
- **Creates mechanisms for peaceful coexistence of viewpoints:** 4.0/5.0
- **Prevents escalation into broader food classification conflicts:** 4.0/5.0
- **Maintains practical utility for restaurants, regulations, and consumers:** 4.0/5.0

### Resource Requirements
