## Raw LLM Response

This is the individual strategic plan generated by the Leader Agent:

### Hotdog-Sandwich Taxonomy Consensus Framework

**Timeline:** 12-18 months

#### Step 1: Establish a Hotdog-Sandwich Classification Council (HSCC)

**Prerequisites:**
- Gain buy-in from key stakeholder groups

**Expected Outcome:** Create a legitimate, authoritative body to define and maintain hotdog-sandwich taxonomy

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty achieving balanced representation
- Potential for Council decisions to be ignored or disputed

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 2: Define a Hybrid Taxonomy Model

**Prerequisites:**
- Comprehensive review of structural, cultural, and culinary perspectives
- Establish Council decision-making process

**Expected Outcome:** Taxonomy that recognizes both structural sandwich criteria and distinct cultural/culinary hotdog identity

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty reconciling conflicting viewpoints
- Potential for model to be seen as overly complex or arbitrary

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 3: Implement Flexible Labeling and Regulatory Standards

**Prerequisites:**
- Finalize Hybrid Taxonomy Model
- Gain buy-in from regulatory bodies and industry

**Expected Outcome:** Clear, consistent guidelines for food service, packaging, and consumer understanding

**Key Risks:**
- Resistance from entrenched positions
- Potential for loopholes or inconsistent application

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 4: Launch Public Education Campaign

**Prerequisites:**
- Establish Hybrid Taxonomy as authoritative standard
- Develop clear, engaging communication materials

**Expected Outcome:** Broad public awareness and acceptance of Hybrid Taxonomy

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty overcoming existing biases and assumptions
- Potential for continued debate and controversy

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 5: Institutionalize Periodic Taxonomy Review

**Prerequisites:**
- Hybrid Taxonomy in active use
- Establish HSCC as permanent governing body

**Expected Outcome:** Maintain relevance and legitimacy of Hybrid Taxonomy over time

**Key Risks:**
- Potential for political capture of HSCC
- Difficulty achieving consensus on future changes

**Confidence:** 0.8

### Strategic Alignment

- **Respects structural and cultural perspectives:** 5.0/5.0
- **Establishes legitimate taxonomic authority:** 4.0/5.0
- **Enables peaceful coexistence of viewpoints:** 4.0/5.0
- **Prevents escalation into broader food conflicts:** 4.0/5.0
- **Maintains practical utility:** 5.0/5.0

### Resource Requirements
