## Raw LLM Response

This is the individual strategic plan generated by the Leader Agent:

### Hotdog-Sandwich Unification Framework

**Timeline:** 12-18 months

#### Step 1: Establish a Hotdog-Sandwich Classification Council

**Prerequisites:**
- Secure buy-in from key stakeholder groups

**Expected Outcome:** Create a legitimate, authoritative body to define classification standards

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty getting all stakeholders to agree on council composition and decision-making process
- Potential for council to be seen as biased or lacking legitimacy

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 2: Develop a Hybrid Classification System

**Prerequisites:**
- Council has established its legitimacy and authority

**Expected Outcome:** A framework that recognizes both structural and cultural dimensions of hotdog-sandwich taxonomy

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty balancing competing definitional criteria
- Potential for new system to be seen as overly complex or impractical

**Confidence:** 0.7

#### Step 3: Implement Dual Labeling and Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

**Prerequisites:**
- Hybrid classification system is defined and accepted

**Expected Outcome:** Allows for peaceful coexistence of differing viewpoints, with clear procedures for resolving disputes

**Key Risks:**
- Resistance from stakeholders who want a single definitive answer
- Potential for abuse of dispute resolution process

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 4: Launch Public Education and Cultural Integration Campaign

**Prerequisites:**
- Hybrid classification system and dispute resolution mechanisms are in place

**Expected Outcome:** Increase public understanding and acceptance of the new framework, preventing escalation into broader food taxonomy conflicts

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty overcoming entrenched beliefs and biases
- Potential for backlash from ideological purists on both sides

**Confidence:** 0.7
