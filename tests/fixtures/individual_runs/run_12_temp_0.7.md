## Raw LLM Response

This is the individual strategic plan generated by the Leader Agent:

### Resolving the Hotdog-Sandwich Controversy

**Timeline:** 18-24 months

#### Step 1: Establish a Hotdog-Sandwich Classification Council

**Prerequisites:**
- Secure buy-in from key stakeholder groups

**Expected Outcome:** A legitimate, authoritative body to define food taxonomy standards

**Key Risks:**
- Stakeholders may not agree on Council composition or decision-making process
- Council may lack enforcement power over holdout groups

**Confidence:** 0.7

#### Step 2: Develop a Taxonomy Framework that Integrates Structural and Cultural Criteria

**Prerequisites:**
- Council has been established
- Comprehensive review of existing taxonomic models

**Expected Outcome:** A classification system that balances objective structural analysis with subjective cultural considerations

**Key Risks:**
- Framework may still leave ambiguous edge cases
- Stakeholders may resist compromises that don't fully align with their views

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 3: Establish Formal Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

**Prerequisites:**
- Taxonomy framework has been defined
- Key stakeholders have agreed to participate in resolution process

**Expected Outcome:** A fair, transparent process for adjudicating classification disagreements

**Key Risks:**
- Stakeholders may still refuse to accept rulings that go against their positions
- Dispute resolution process could become overly bureaucratic and slow

**Confidence:** 0.7

#### Step 4: Promote Public Education and Consensus-Building Campaigns

**Prerequisites:**
- Taxonomy framework and dispute resolution mechanisms are in place
- Funding and resources secured for public outreach

**Expected Outcome:** Widespread public acceptance and internalization of the official food taxonomy

**Key Risks:**
- Entrenched viewpoints may be difficult to change through education alone
- Public may become fatigued by ongoing "food wars" messaging

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 5: Establish Hotdog-Sandwich Coexistence Standards

**Prerequisites:**
- Public has generally accepted the taxonomy framework
- Dispute resolution process is functioning effectively

**Expected Outcome:** Clear guidelines for restaurants, regulators, and consumers on how to properly identify and label hotdogs and sandwiches

**Key Risks:**
- Some stakeholders may still resist any formal recognition of the opposing category
- Standards may become overly complex or impractical to implement

**Confidence:** 0.7
