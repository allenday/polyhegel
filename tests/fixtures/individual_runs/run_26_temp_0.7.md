### Hotdog-Sandwich Taxonomy Resolution Framework

**Timeline:** 12-18 months

#### Step 1: Establish a Hotdog-Sandwich Classification Commission

**Prerequisites:**
- Secure buy-in from key stakeholder groups

**Expected Outcome:** Create an authoritative body to develop a comprehensive taxonomic standard

**Key Risks:**
- Difficulty achieving consensus among diverse stakeholders
- Potential for political interference or lobbying

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 2: Develop a Hybrid Taxonomic Model

**Prerequisites:**
- Commission gathers input from structural, cultural, and practical experts

**Expected Outcome:** A classification framework that balances structural, cultural, and functional criteria

**Key Risks:**

- Potential for continued debate over edge cases and ambiguous items

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 3: Establish Formal Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

**Prerequisites:**
- Commission defines clear decision-making processes and appeals procedures

**Expected Outcome:** Provide legitimate channels for stakeholders to resolve classification disagreements

**Key Risks:**
- Resistance to ceding authority to a centralized decision-making body
- Potential for politicization of the dispute resolution process

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 4: Launch Public Education and Engagement Campaign

**Prerequisites:**
- Commission develops accessible explanations of the taxonomic framework
- Secure media partnerships to widely disseminate information

**Expected Outcome:** Increase public understanding and acceptance of the classification standards

**Key Risks:**

- Potential for continued public debate and 'food classification wars'

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 5: Integrate Taxonomy into Regulations and Industry Standards

**Prerequisites:**
- Obtain buy-in from relevant government agencies and industry associations

**Expected Outcome:** Ensure consistent application of the classification framework across sectors

**Key Risks:**
- Resistance from entrenched industry practices and regulatory inertia
- Potential for unintended consequences or loopholes in implementation

**Confidence:** 0.8
