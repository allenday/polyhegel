**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 3: Establish Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

**Prerequisites:**
- Taxonomy Commission has authority to make binding rulings
- Stakeholders agree to abide by Commission decisions

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 4: Launch Public Education Campaign

**Prerequisites:**
- Dual-classification system and dispute resolution mechanisms in place
- Stakeholders aligned on consistent public messaging

**Expected Outcome:** General public understands and accepts hotdog taxonomy framework

**Confidence:** 0.8

#### Step 5: Periodically Review and Refine the Framework

**Prerequisites:**
- Ongoing monitoring of implementation and stakeholder feedback
