# Release Management Guide

## Release Process Overview

Polyhegel follows semantic versioning (SemVer) and maintains a structured release process to ensure stability and clear communication of changes.

## Version Numbering

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
We use the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward-compatible functionality
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward-compatible changes

### Version Examples
- `1.0.0` - Initial stable release
- `1.1.0` - New features added (backward compatible)
- `1.1.1` - Bug fixes (backward compatible)
- `2.0.0` - Breaking changes (not backward compatible)

### Pre-release Versions
- `1.2.0-alpha.1` - Alpha release for early testing
- `1.2.0-beta.1` - Beta release for broader testing
- `1.2.0-rc.1` - Release candidate, feature complete

## Release Types

### Major Releases (x.0.0)
**When to Release**:
- Breaking API changes
- Architectural changes requiring migration
- Removal of deprecated features
- Major new functionality that changes core behavior

**Process**:
1. Create release branch from `dev`
2. Update migration documentation
3. Create breaking change documentation
4. Extended testing period (2+ weeks)
5. Community feedback period
6. Release candidate testing

### Minor Releases (x.y.0)
**When to Release**:
- New features and capabilities
- New strategic techniques or domains
- Performance improvements
- New integrations or protocols

**Process**:
1. Feature freeze on `dev` branch
2. Comprehensive testing cycle
3. Documentation updates
4. Beta release for testing
5. Final release

### Patch Releases (x.y.z)
**When to Release**:
- Bug fixes
- Security patches
- Performance improvements
- Documentation corrections

**Process**:
1. Cherry-pick fixes to release branch
2. Focused testing on affected areas
3. Quick release cycle (same day to 1 week)

# Migration Guide: v1.x to v2.0

## Overview
Version 2.0 introduces significant improvements to the strategic technique system
and A2A agent architecture. This guide helps you migrate existing code.

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Strategic Technique API Changes

#### Before (v1.x)
```python
from polyhegel.techniques import ResourceTechnique

technique = ResourceTechnique()
result = technique.apply(strategy, context)
```

#### After (v2.0)
```python
from polyhegel.strategic_techniques import get_technique, StrategyDomain

technique = get_technique("resource_optimization", StrategyDomain.RESOURCE_ACQUISITION)
result = await technique.generate_strategy(context)
```

### 2. Configuration Changes

#### Before (v1.x)
```python
config = {
    "model": "claude-3-haiku",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "agents": ["leader", "follower"]
}
```

#### After (v2.0)  
```python
from polyhegel.config import PolyhegelConfig

config = PolyhegelConfig(
    model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    default_temperature=0.7,
    a2a_endpoints=A2AAgentEndpoints.from_env()
)
```
