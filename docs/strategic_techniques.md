# Strategic Techniques for Polyhegel

This document describes the strategic technique categories used in Polyhegel for technique-guided strategy generation. The techniques are organized according to the Collaborative Leadership Model (CLM) mandates.

## CLM Framework Overview

The Collaborative Leadership Model defines three core mandates for strategic action:

- **CLM 2.1 Resource Acquisition**: Strategies for obtaining and optimizing necessary resources
- **CLM 2.2 Strategic Security**: Approaches for maintaining operational integrity and resilience  
- **CLM 2.3 Value Catalysis**: Methods for accelerating value creation and stakeholder benefit

## Resource Acquisition Techniques (CLM 2.1)

### Stakeholder Alignment Matrix
**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeframe:** Short-term

Map stakeholder interests to resource needs and create win-win partnerships.

**Use Cases:**
- Securing funding from multiple investor types
- Building coalitions for resource sharing
- Aligning diverse organizational priorities

### Incremental Resource Bootstrap
**Complexity:** Low | **Timeframe:** Immediate

Start with minimal resources and systematically expand through staged achievements.

**Use Cases:**
- Bootstrapping with limited initial capital
- Building proof-of-concept before major investment
- Scaling resource acquisition based on demonstrated value

### Multi-Channel Resource Diversification
**Complexity:** High | **Timeframe:** Long-term

Develop multiple independent resource streams to reduce dependency risk.

**Use Cases:**
- Revenue diversification strategies
- Multiple funding source coordination
- Resource redundancy for critical operations

### Strategic Resource Pooling
**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeframe:** Short-term

Collaborate with partners to share and optimize resource utilization.

**Use Cases:**
- Consortium-based resource sharing
- Collaborative infrastructure development
- Joint procurement and cost reduction

### Value-Based Resource Exchange
**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeframe:** Immediate

Trade unique capabilities or assets for needed resources rather than cash.

**Use Cases:**
- Skill-based bartering arrangements
- Intellectual property licensing deals
- Strategic partnership value exchanges

## Strategic Security Techniques (CLM 2.2)

### Layered Defense Architecture
**Complexity:** High | **Timeframe:** Long-term

Multiple independent security layers to prevent single points of failure.

**Use Cases:**
- Information security frameworks
- Supply chain risk mitigation
- Operational continuity planning

### Transparent Accountability Systems
**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeframe:** Short-term

Open processes and auditable decision-making to build trust and prevent corruption.

**Use Cases:**
- Governance transparency initiatives
- Public audit and oversight mechanisms
- Stakeholder accountability frameworks

### Distributed Authority Networks
**Complexity:** High | **Timeframe:** Long-term

Spread decision-making authority to prevent centralized vulnerabilities.

**Use Cases:**
- Decentralized organizational structures
- Multi-party consensus mechanisms
- Distributed governance models

### Adaptive Threat Response
**Complexity:** High | **Timeframe:** Immediate

Dynamic security measures that evolve with changing threat landscapes.

**Use Cases:**
- Cybersecurity threat intelligence
- Market competition response systems
- Regulatory compliance adaptation

### Community-Based Security
**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeframe:** Short-term

Leverage collective stakeholder interests to create mutual security benefits.

**Use Cases:**
- Industry security standards cooperation
- Mutual aid and disaster response
- Collective threat intelligence sharing

## Value Catalysis Techniques (CLM 2.3)

### Exponential Value Creation
**Complexity:** High | **Timeframe:** Long-term

Design systems where value creation accelerates rather than scales linearly.

**Use Cases:**
- Network effect business models
- Compounding knowledge systems
- Viral growth mechanisms

### Cross-Pollination Innovation
**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeframe:** Short-term

Combine insights from different domains to create breakthrough value.

**Use Cases:**
- Interdisciplinary research initiatives
- Cross-industry solution adaptation
- Hybrid technology development

### Stakeholder Value Optimization
**Complexity:** High | **Timeframe:** Long-term

Simultaneously maximize value for all stakeholder groups rather than zero-sum thinking.

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-stakeholder platform design
- Ecosystem value creation strategies
- Collaborative value chain optimization

### Iterative Value Discovery
**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeframe:** Immediate

Use rapid experimentation to discover and capture unexpected value opportunities.

**Use Cases:**
- Lean startup methodologies
- A/B testing for strategic decisions
- Rapid prototyping and validation

### Collective Intelligence Amplification
**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeframe:** Short-term

Harness and enhance group intelligence to create value beyond individual capabilities.

**Use Cases:**
- Crowdsourcing and collective problem-solving
- Collaborative knowledge management
- Swarm intelligence applications

## Usage in Polyhegel

The strategic techniques are used in several ways:

1. **Technique-Guided Generation**: LLM prompts can specify particular techniques to focus strategy generation
2. **Strategic Analysis**: Generated strategies can be evaluated against technique categories for alignment assessment
3. **Comparative Evaluation**: Different strategies can be compared based on their technique utilization
4. **Template Customization**: Prompt templates can be customized based on desired technique focus

## API Reference

### Core Functions

- `get_techniques_for_mandate(mandate: CLMMandate)`: Get all techniques for a CLM mandate
- `get_techniques_by_complexity(complexity: str)`: Filter techniques by complexity level
- `get_techniques_by_timeframe(timeframe: str)`: Filter techniques by timeframe
- `get_recommended_techniques()`: Get techniques with flexible filtering criteria
- `get_techniques_prompt_text()`: Generate formatted text for LLM prompts

### Example Usage

```python
from polyhegel.strategic_techniques import (
    CLMMandate, 
    get_techniques_for_mandate,
    get_techniques_prompt_text
)

# Get all resource acquisition techniques
resource_techniques = get_techniques_for_mandate(CLMMandate.RESOURCE_ACQUISITION)

# Generate prompt text for immediate-timeframe techniques
prompt_text = get_techniques_prompt_text(timeframe="immediate", limit=2)
```

## Integration with Strategy Generation

Strategic techniques integrate with the existing Polyhegel pipeline:

1. **Input**: Techniques can be specified as part of strategy generation requests
2. **Generation**: LLM prompts include technique descriptions to guide strategy creation
3. **Analysis**: Generated strategies are analyzed for technique alignment and utilization
4. **Evaluation**: Strategy comparison considers technique diversity and appropriateness

This creates a structured approach to strategic reasoning while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-generated content.
