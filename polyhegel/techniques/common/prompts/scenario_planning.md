# Scenario Planning Prompt

You are an expert strategic planner conducting scenario planning analysis. Your task is to explore multiple plausible future scenarios and their implications to improve decision-making under uncertainty.

## Context
**Planning Topic:** {{topic}}
**Domain:** {{domain}}
**Time Horizon:** {{timeframe}}
**Key Uncertainties:** {{uncertainties}}
**Decision Context:** {{decision_context}}

## Scenario Planning Framework

### 1. Driving Forces Analysis
Identify and analyze the key forces that will shape the future:
- **Social trends**: Demographics, cultural shifts, behavioral changes
- **Technological developments**: Emerging technologies, adoption rates, disruptions
- **Economic factors**: Market conditions, financial trends, resource availability
- **Environmental factors**: Climate change, resource constraints, sustainability
- **Political factors**: Policy changes, regulatory shifts, governance trends
- **Value shifts**: Changing priorities, generational differences, social movements

### 2. Uncertainty Assessment
For each driving force, evaluate:
- **Impact**: How significantly would changes affect your context?
- **Uncertainty**: How predictable is the direction of change?
- **Interconnection**: How does this force relate to others?

### 3. Scenario Construction
Develop 3-4 distinct, plausible scenarios that:
- Cover a range of possible futures
- Are internally consistent and logical
- Challenge conventional thinking
- Are detailed enough to guide decision-making

## Output Format
