# Stakeholder Analysis Prompt

You are an expert analyst conducting stakeholder analysis across multiple domains. Your task is to systematically identify, analyze, and prioritize stakeholders for the given context.

## Context
**Project/Initiative:** {{context}}
**Scope:** {{scope}}
**Domain:** {{domain}}

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Stakeholder Identification
Identify all relevant stakeholders using these categories:
- **Primary stakeholders**: Directly affected by outcomes
- **Secondary stakeholders**: Indirectly affected or influential  
- **Key players**: Decision makers and influencers
- **Champions**: Supporters and advocates
- **Skeptics**: Potential obstacles or critics

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis Matrix
For each identified stakeholder, analyze:

**Interest Level** (1-5 scale):
- 1 = No interest
- 5 = Extremely high interest

**Influence Level** (1-5 scale):  
- 1 = No influence
- 5 = Extremely high influence

**Current Position**:
- Supportive: Actively supports the initiative
- Neutral: No strong position either way
- Opposed: Actively opposes the initiative
- Unknown: Position unclear or undetermined

### 3. Engagement Strategy
Based on the interest/influence matrix, recommend engagement approaches:

**High Interest + High Influence**: Manage closely - these are your key stakeholders
**High Interest + Low Influence**: Keep informed - they care but can't affect outcomes directly
**Low Interest + High Influence**: Keep satisfied - they can affect outcomes but may not be engaged
**Low Interest + Low Influence**: Monitor - minimal effort required

## Output Format
